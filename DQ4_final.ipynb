In this part, you should explore the  businesses and types of businesses that have been reported. To attempt to answer this, you have been provided data from the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview). Each file is formatted as a json. The values are as follows:\n",
    "* `mapped_location`: The mapped location from the hubNashville dataset\n",
    "* `address`: The address from the hubNashville dataset\n",
    "* `results`: The first five results from a Google Maps API nearbysearch, ranked by proximity to the Mapped Location. See https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search#PlaceSearchResponses for more details on the fields in the results.\n",
